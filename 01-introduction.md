# Introduction

## Motivation

The OpenCourseMatch application is designed to address the challenges and complexity of assigning a wide range of users based on a few preferences and constraints.
Doing this manually is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with large datasets.
Through a web application, OpenCourseMatch aims to automate the process by allowing the users to submit their preferences online—on any device of their choice (with an internet connection...)—and then running an algorithm to assign them to one of their chosen courses.
The application is built on the principles of open-source software, allowing for transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
By making the source code available to the public, we encourage contributions from developers, educators, and researchers to enhance the functionality and performance of the application.

## Core Features

The core features of the application include:

- Creating accounts manually or by importing them from a CSV file
- Registering courses with their respective constraints
- Saving course preferences
- assigning the users to the courses automatically with the algorithm
- Optimizing the generated assignments manually
- Generating reports for the assignments
